Not skimming for takeaways, but savoring words, letting them settle, and engaging deeply with ideas.\u200b\nMy slow reading journey began when I realized I\u2019d finish books yet recall little\u2014racing to the end like checking a box, only to feel empty. So I grabbed a physical novel, set a 30-minute timer, and vowed to pause.\u200b\nThe shift was striking. I noticed details: sunlight through windows, subtle humor, quiet foreshadowing\u2014like switching from standard definition to 4K.\u200b\nSlow reading enriches more than literary enjoyment; it rekindles active thinking. You pause to ponder, look up words, or jot thoughts, turning reading from passive to participatory.\u200b\nIt\u2019s not easy amid pressure to \u201ckeep up,\u201d but I see it as self-care\u2014a way to carve calm in chaos, to honor what\u2019s worth savoring.\u200b\nIf digital burnout weighs on you, try it: one page, no distractions. Let words linger. In a world chasing speed, slow reading is a small, powerful act of presence\u2014something we all need more of.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1755245387, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2025-08-15", "dateLabelColor": "#0969da"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "Insight": "#1eb251", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "Hunk jia", "faviconUrl": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://hunkjia.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
