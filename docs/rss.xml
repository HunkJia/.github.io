Not skimming for takeaways, but savoring words, letting them settle, and engaging deeply with ideas.​
My slow reading journey began when I realized I’d finish books yet recall little—racing to the end like checking a box, only to feel empty. So I grabbed a physical novel, set a 30-minute timer, and vowed to pause.​
The shift was striking. I noticed details: sunlight through windows, subtle humor, quiet foreshadowing—like switching from standard definition to 4K.​
Slow reading enriches more than literary enjoyment; it rekindles active thinking. You pause to ponder, look up words, or jot thoughts, turning reading from passive to participatory.​
It’s not easy amid pressure to “keep up,” but I see it as self-care—a way to carve calm in chaos, to honor what’s worth savoring.​
If digital burnout weighs on you, try it: one page, no distractions. Let words linger. In a world chasing speed, slow reading is a small, powerful act of presence—something we all need more of.。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://hunkjia.github.io/post/The%20Joy%20of%20Slow%20Reading%20in%20a%20Fast-Paced%20World.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 08:09:47 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
